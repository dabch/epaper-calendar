# epaper-calendar
RasPi-powered e-paper calendar using python and [Waveshare's 7.5" e-paper display](https://www.waveshare.com/product/mini-pc/raspberry-pi/displays/e-paper/7.5inch-e-paper-hat.htm)

## Demonstration
This is a screenshot of what's showing on the screen (generated by Pillow) and how neat that actually looks on the epaper! ;)

## Dependencies
- Pillow (tested with version 6.0.0; version 4 does **not** work) *(installable via pip, the version from raspbian repos is outdated)*
- [irgangla's iCal library](https://github.com/irgangla/icalevents) *(installable via pip)*
- [Waveshare e-paper library](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper) *(current version at development time included in this repo)*

## Configuration
The calendar data is pulled from the internet via an iCal Link. This link, and some other config info, has to be provided in a `config.py` file. Copy or rename `config.py.example` to `config.py` and enter the URL(s) in the following fashion:
```
URLS = ["http://url1.com/xyz", "https://url2.com/calendar/script/whatever"]
```
In this file, you can also set the number of days to show, timezone, text sizes and some other stuff. Most you should leave at default, except for maybe the items written in CAPS.

## Code structure
Currently the main file is `beautiful_calendar.py`, it contains all the drawing work. iCal operations and event preparation are outsourced to `ical_worker.py`.
To run the program, execute `beautiful_calendar.py` using python 3!
