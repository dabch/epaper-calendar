            variable explanations: (this shit is complicated...)

            days_duration: the number of days the event spans. For an event going from midnight
                        to midnight, this would be 1. For an event going from 23:55 to 00:05 this
                        would be 2.
                        This reflects the actual properties of the event and NOT the number
                        of days inside the calendar timeframe.
            
            start_day:  The index of the day on which the event starts, relative to our calendar
                        timeframe. 0 is the first day shown on the calendar, 1 the second etc.
                        start_day can be negative if the event has already started outside the
                        calendar timeframe (e.g. two days ago, then it would be -2)

            These two variables are then used to iterate over the intersection of the days that
            the event spans and the days inside the calendar timeframe, with the loop counter
            (named days) again being the current day's index relative to the calendar timeframe,
            just as start_day.
            So essentially we are iterating over range(start_day, start_day + days_duration), but
            because calendars are a bitch it's more complicated. The min and max just make sure 
            we only iterate over the days of the event that are in our calendar timeframe.
